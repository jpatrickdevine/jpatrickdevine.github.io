    I've been coding HTML & CSS since I was a teenager, and have always been intellectually curious when it comes to engineering and tech. A few years ago, I decided to go back to school for IT, studying Programming and Application Development. Check out a few of my personal <a href="{{ site.url }}/projects/">projects</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jpatrickdevine">repos</a>.
